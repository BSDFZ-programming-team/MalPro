# Background & Our Ideas

## What does our project do?

There are many products that use raw PE(.exe) file to classify malwares by using machine learning and/or extracting PE features. But instead, We are using assembly file of the raw PE file (generated by IDA) to classify it. 

Our project can classify 582 types of malware behaviour.

**And for the Beta version, only 9 types is supported, we are still searching for a way to train a better model that could classify 582 types of malware.**

## Our ideas

### The background of our idea

When we are doing our research, we have noticed a bunch of project using cnn(or malconv, random forest, etc.) to classify the malware. 

Then, we saw a competition held by Microsoft (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/malware-classification) that use .asm file to classify 9 different types of malware family. 

So could we classify more types of it? We have learned about the blogs, articles and interviews published by the champions of this competition. Finally, we decided that classifying by assembly file would be a good idea.

### Why assembly file?

Features in assembly file are easier to be learned by machines than raw PE file.

We try to prove this as rigorous as possible, but because of the lack of time and cpu(I'm dead serious), we could only say that when  you got 6000s and one cpu, training random forest models by using assembly file is better than PE file.

If you are interested in it, see [blog](#blog).

### Advantage of assembly files

The powerful features in assembly files are: 

	* .asm image features
	* opgram-ncode features
	
We train our random forest model by using these two features

by the way, we use 1500px for the .asm image features and n=3 for the opgram-ncode features in this project.

# Dataset

*Testing machine: ultra9 32GB cpu*

## For primary model (9 malware families)

Dataset: [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/malware-classification)

### Performance

dataset size: 2480 malwares (train:test=9:1)
malware families: 9 types  
accuracy: 0.9959677419354839  
time spent in extracting features: 36s(.asm image features) + 8min34s(opcode-3gram features)  
time spent in training: less than 10s  

## For advanced model (582 malware families) 

**STILL DEVELOPING**

Dataset: [BODMAS dataset](https://whyisyoung.github.io/BODMAS)

### Performance

NONE

# Project usage

there is a model trained by us in the project file (model/model.pt), so you can predict the malware without training on your own

## requirments

### install python libraries

*TIPS: we recommend python 3.9 for this*

```
pip install -r requirments.txt
```

*TIPS: we recommend you to create a new virtual environment for this project because it depends on some libraries in old version*

### install IDA pro

install IDA pro (7.x) from [here](https://hex-rays.com/IDA-pro/)

TODO: Use IDA to turn PE files into assembly files.

## Examples(Quick Use)

```
python main.py
```

we upload one malware sample for each kind of the malware families(9 types). You can use main.py to examine the model. 

choose "Predict malware(.asm) directly(using ./model/model.pt)" in the menu and enter the location of one of the examples(or you can download raw PE files of those 9 types of malwares and use IDA to generate assembly files as your own samples), then you will get a predict result.

## Examine

### predict

```
python server.py
```

It will run a web server on your host(port 7777) as the frontend of our project, open it and upload your PE file, you will see a result like this.

**We are now developing features of turning the uploaded PE file to asm by using IDA pro. so for now this server could only give out NON-VIRUS result, that is, we only support assembly file now.** 
**if you want to predict your assembly file, use main.py.**

download the analyze details if you want. 

### train

**download .asm dataset with labels**

Because the program is still developing, we can't use the BODMAS dataset yet. Instead, you can download the dataset of [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/malware-classification) which contains 9 types of malware famlies

**create /train folder and TrainLabels.csv**

copy your data set to /train and your label file to TrainLabels.csv(same label file format in the kaggle challenge)

*TIPS: if your train set is a subset of your label file(rename it to trainLabels_all.csv), use utils/convert.py to fix it.*

**Run main.py to train the model**

`python main.py`

it will show a menu like this

you can train your model in this script
