# Background & Our Ideas

## What does our project do?

There are many products that use raw PE(.exe) file to classify malwares by using machine learning and/or extracting PE features. But instead, We are using assembly file of the raw PE file (generated by IDA) to classify it. 

Our project can classify **85** types of malware families now(for beta versions), and we will support 147 types in the future.

All families we supported is in malware_families_list.json

## Our ideas

### The background of our idea

When we are doing our research, we have noticed a bunch of project using cnn(or malconv, random forest, etc.) to classify the malware. 

Then, we saw a competition held by Microsoft (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/malware-classification) that use .asm file to classify 9 different types of malware family. 

So could we classify more types of it? We have learned about the blogs, articles and interviews published by the champions of this competition. Finally, we decided that classifying by assembly file would be a good idea.

### Why assembly file?

Features in assembly file are easier to be learned by machines than raw PE file.

We try to prove this as rigorous as possible, but because of the lack of time and cpu(I'm dead serious), we could only say that when you got 6000s and one cpu, training random forest models by using assembly file is better than PE file.

If you are interested in it, see [blog](#blog).

### Advantage of assembly files

The powerful features in assembly files are: 

	* opgram-ncode features
	
We recommand n=3 or n=4 for the opgram-ncode features to train the random forest model.

*NOTE: You can customise the 'n' in opcode-ngram features when training models in main.py*

# Project usage

there is a model trained by us in the project file (model/model.pt), so you can predict the malware without training on your own

## requirments

### install python libraries

```
pip install -r requirments.txt
```

*TIPS: we recommend you to create a new python 3.9 virtual environment for this project because it depends on some libraries in old version*

### install IDA pro

install IDA pro (7.x) from [here](https://hex-rays.com/IDA-pro/)

**Change {ida_install_dir}/idc/analysis.idc**

![image](https://files.cnblogs.com/files/blogs/820580/image.ico?t=1723102253&download=true)

line41: 

from
```
gen_file(OFILE_ASM, fhandle, 0, BADADDR, 0); // create the assembler file  
```
to
```
gen_file(OFILE_LST, fhandle, 0, BADADDR, 0); // create the assembler file  
```

**Change {ida_install_dir}/cfg/ida.cfg**

![image](https://files.cnblogs.com/files/blogs/820580/example4.ico?t=1723102635&download=true)

line 399:

from
```
OPCODE_BYTES            = 0   // display this many instruction/data bytes (0 to disable)
```
to
```
OPCODE_BYTES            = 16   // display this many instruction/data bytes (0 to disable)
```


## Examples(Quick Use)

```
python main.py
```

we upload one malware sample for each kind of the malware families(50 types). You can use main.py to examine the model. 

There are two models using n=4(deafult) and n=3 are uploaded.  

*The two model files is over 100MB(too large to upload) so we upload .zip file of it, don't forget to unzip*  

*But in the release vesion, the models are not in zip files*  

Change the model file to n=3 if you want.

choose "Predict malware(.asm) directly(using ./model/model.pt)" in the menu and enter the location of one of the examples(or you can download raw PE files of those 9 types of malwares and use IDA to generate assembly files as your own samples), then you will get a predict result.

## Examine

### predict

```
python server.py
```

It will run a web server on your host(port 7777) as the frontend of our project, open it and upload your PE file, you will see a result like this.

**ONLY SUPPORT 85 TYPES OF MALWARE FAMILIES**

download the analyze details if you want. 

### train

**download .asm dataset with labels**

You can download the dataset of [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/malware-classification) which contains 9 types of malware famlies.  

Or you can download other PE malware dataset and turn them to LST file in IDA and label them.


**create /train folder and TrainLabels.csv**

copy your data set to /train and your label file to TrainLabels.csv(same label file format in the kaggle challenge)

*TIPS: if your train set is a subset of your label file(rename it to trainLabels_all.csv), use utils/convert.py to fix it.*

**Run main.py to train the model**

`python main.py`

it will show a menu like this  

![image](https://files.cnblogs.com/files/blogs/820580/example2.ico?t=1723186123&download=true)

you can train your model in this script
